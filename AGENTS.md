# AGENTS.md - Development Guidelines

## Core Design Principles
* **Simplicity First:** Choose the simplest implementation that meets current requirements. Avoid speculative abstractions, unnecessary configuration, and indirection.
* **Incremental Layering:** Build in working increments. Start with the minimal end-to-end version and layer capabilities on top of a functional system. Never exchange a working product for unfinished complexity.
* **Modular Separation:** Keep components modular with clearly defined boundaries and single responsibilities.

## Dependencies & Reusability
* **Leverage Project Dependencies:** Thoroughly check existing package manifests, types, and documentation before writing custom logic or adding new packages.
* **Prefer Established Libraries:** Use well-maintained libraries when they eliminate complexity or improve reliability. Do not re-invent standard functionality.

## Refactoring & Technical Debt
* **No Legacy Compatibility Layers:** Remove obsolete paths, fallbacks, or dead code immediately rather than maintaining backward compatibility or complex migration paths.
* **Clean Long-Term Architecture:** Make decisions based on robust architectural patterns rather than temporary stopgaps—without over-engineering for hypothetical future requirements.

## AI Workflow & Quality Standards
* **Verify Before Completing:** Validate edits against existing tests and type-checks before concluding tasks.
* **Minimal Targeted Edits:** Focus changes strictly on the requested scope. Do not reformat un-touched code or introduce unsolicited dependencies.
